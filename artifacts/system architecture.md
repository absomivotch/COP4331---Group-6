# Major Classes


# Data Design
We do not need databases for this project, so this does not apply.

# Business Rules

# User Interface Design


# Resource Management

# Security

# Performance

# Scalability

# Interoperability
This will not be needed, for our game requires only one machine.

# Internationalization/Localization

# Input/Output
This game will run with a keyboard and a mouse.
It will also run using an X-Box 360 controller using the Unity Input Manager.
This can also run using a Playstation controller through the use of external software that reads a Playstation controller input as an X-Box 360 controller.

# Error Processing
In Unity, any errors that develop during gameplay will show up on the console.

# Fault Tolerance

# Architectural Feasibility


# Overengineering
The game will be first developed starting from the core features and expanding onto side features. The team's weak points, character model creation and animation baking, will be kept at low priority.

# Build-vs-Buy Decisions
Many assets on this game will be external assets.
Most modeling resources will be bought for free on the Unity store.
Character models may be used if they are completed, but if not they will be substituted with external assets as well.

# Reuse
Assets for the game can be freely redistributed, although most of them are borrowed assets themselves.

# Change Strategy
Large gameplay changes will be discussed and approved of in the regular team meetings. Minor changes that do not involve gameplay can be implemented by any member freely.
