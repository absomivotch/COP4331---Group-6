# Major Classes

<img src = "/artifacts/classDiagram.png">

# Data Design
We do not need databases for this project, so this does not apply.

# Business Rules
Since this is a game, it is expected to be playable. Also, players of this game are expected to read English.
...Perhaps I should say instead that players of this game are expected to be able to read.
This is all that is generally expected of this game and its players.

# User Interface Design

# Resource Management
Resources for this project will consist of the Game Assets, Scripts, and Scenes.
Since most Assets will be borrowed, we will not be using any that will disrupt the frame rate of the game.
Scripts that run for too long and disrupt down gameplay will be either modified or discarded.
There is no limit to the size of Scenes. They will be as large or as small as they need to be.

# Security
The Unity Project will be stored on github for anyone to download.
It will also be stored on each team member's computer(s).
Therefore, the security the game has is minimal.


# Performance
Although this is a 3D game, it is set up like 2D and is not expected to be particularly performance heavy.

# Scalability

# Interoperability
This will not be needed, for our game requires only one machine.

# Internationalization/Localization

# Input/Output
This game will run with a keyboard and a mouse.
It will also run using an X-Box 360 controller using the Unity Input Manager.
This can also run using a Playstation controller through the use of external software that reads a Playstation controller input as an X-Box 360 controller.

# Error Processing
In Unity, any errors that develop during gameplay will show up on the console.

# Fault Tolerance

# Architectural Feasibility


# Overengineering
The game will be first developed starting from the core features and expanding onto side features. The team's weak points, character model creation and animation baking, will be kept at low priority.

# Build-vs-Buy Decisions
Many assets on this game will be external assets.
Most modeling resources will be bought for free on the Unity store.
Character models may be used if they are completed, but if not they will be substituted with external assets as well.

# Reuse
Assets for the game can be freely redistributed, although most of them are borrowed assets themselves.

# Change Strategy
Large gameplay changes will be discussed and approved of in the regular team meetings. Minor changes that do not involve gameplay can be implemented by any member freely.
