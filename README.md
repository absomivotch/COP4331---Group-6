## Banana Bandana Savanna
### Product Vision
---

Hello! We’re Group 6 and our product will be a video game that we’ve titled ‘Banana Bandana Savanna’.
Made in Unity, this game will be a fun Top-Down Turn-Based Strategy game with a capture-the-flag component to it.
Each player will control a team of monkeys to fight an enemy monkey team using banana-based weaponry. Each team will have one monkey wearing a bandana on its head. The objective of the game will be to use your monkeys to ‘capture’ that bandana and bring back to the tree base, avoiding enemy fire and environmental obstacles in order to win.

The reason we have chosen to do this particular product is so that we, as a team, can gain more insight into building tactic-based video games and have fun while doing so. The target audience for this game will be teenagers and adults. However games like this, which encourage strategic thought and team building, can perhaps benefit more than just the intended target audience, bringing entertainment to the masses at large.

In addition to providing entertainment, our game can also help improve strategic thinking capabilities. Other games that have already succeeded in this objective are titles like ‘Worms’ or ‘Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle’. Taking their lead, we’ll see how well our game can compare.
